0. The hackspace welcomes donations, as long as they are useful and do not take up disproportionate amounts of space or time.

0. There is a donations team, who shall manage donations throughout their aquisition, storage, and disposal. This team is formed of members with varying interests, and should consult with other members with specialist knowledge if they are unsure about any aspect of a donation. There is a donations telegram group, limited to members of the donations team, to avoid spamming the main Hackspace chat. Membership of the team is open to any interested member.

0. The donations team can be reached at donations@hacman.org.uk.

0. Any member wishing to donate a small item may do so by placing it in the 1 week box of the bin conveyor.

0. Any item that will not fit in the bin conveyor may only be donated after consulting with the donations team. This can be informal and in person.

0. Every Wednesday a member of the donations team will rotate the boxes of the bin conveyor, indicate that they have done so on the form, and deal with the contents of the last box as donations.

0. The donations team will label all donations with a disposal date - this will be based on an assesment of the uses of the item, as well as any storage concerns. The donations team will then place the item in an appropriate storage location.

0. Any member may dispose of an item with a disposal date in the past.

0. The donations team may decide that a donation is of general, ongoing use to the hackspace. If this is the case, then they will place it an the appropriate storage area.
